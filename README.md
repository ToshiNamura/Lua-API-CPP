# Lua API C++

	Lua API C++ is a solution built on "Microsoft Visual Studio 2022" using "Lua 5.4.4" source code,
	to compile a dynamic lib (DLL), Lua interpreter, Luac compiler.

	Lua API C++ uses the following language standards:
	ISO C++20 (/std:c++20),
	ISO C17 (2018) (/std:c17).
	If you wish, you can use others, but their performance has not been tested and will not be tested.
